# 🧑‍🎓 Student Routine Tracker (Dart Project)

A beginner-friendly Dart console application that helps collect and summarize student information. This project was built to apply fundamental programming concepts like user input, conditions, loops, string handling, and structured output formatting.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This app collects basic student information (name, roll number, city, marks), then calculates:

- Grade based on marks  
- Whether the roll number is even or odd  
- How many vowels exist in the name  

The output is printed in a clean, readable dashboard format.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- `int.parse()` for type conversion  
- Ternary operators for logic evaluation  
- `for-in` loop for counting vowels  
- `List` to store and format final output

## 🖥️ Sample Output

👤 Enter your name: Khurram
🎓 Enter your roll number: 22
🏙️ Enter your city: Peshawar
📊 Enter your marks (0-100): 85
